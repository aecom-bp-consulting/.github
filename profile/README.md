## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Create a new project for each repository, and follow the naming convention:

If creating a repo for a client/internal project:
"Project_PROJECTNAME_CLIENTNAME"

If creating a repo for an application / other diigital content:
"Application_APPNAME_CLIENTNAME"

Note that when creating a repo for an application, if the application is meant for internal use, please write "INTERNAL" where you would usually put "CLIENTNAME".
