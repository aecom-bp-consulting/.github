This is the GitHub account for AECOM's B+P Consulting group.

Create a new repository for each project, and follow this naming convention:

If creating a repo for a client/internal project:
"Project_PROJECTNAME_CLIENTNAME"

If creating a repo for an application / other diigital content:
"Application_APPNAME_CLIENTNAME"

Note that when creating a repo for an application/project, if it is meant for internal use, please write "Internal" where you would usually put "CLIENTNAME".
